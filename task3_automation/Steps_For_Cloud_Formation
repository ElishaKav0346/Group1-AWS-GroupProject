Task 3: Automation Using CloudFormation Guide
    
Step 1: Create YAML Template for CloudFormation
The template will be used to build:
      - A custom VPC
      - A public and private subnet
      - An EC2 instance webserver in the public subnet
      - An EC2 instance database server in the private subnet
      - Internet gateway
      - NAT gateway
      - Route tables 
      - Security groups and routing that:
            - Allow internet access only to the web server
            - Block public access to the database
            - Allow the web server to talk to the database securely
Use VS to create and save your template.


Step 2: Deploy the Template using AWS CloudFormation
Aws Console --> CloudFormation --> Stacks --> Create Stack (with new resources) 
      - Upload a template file
      - Choose the template file you saved in visual studio code
            --> Next
  - Fill in Stack Details
      - Stack Name: Group1-CloudFormation-Stack
      - KeyName Parameter: Group1-Key
            --> Next
      - Configure Stack Options: Leave Defaults 
            --> Next
      - Review and Launch 
            --> Create Stack 
  - Wait for CREATE_COMPLETE


Step 3: Verify if the CloudFormation Stack was Successful
--> Check that you have 2 new EC2 instances 
--> Check for the newly deployed VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, and Security Groups
